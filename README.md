Future changes.
  ---------------Change from constantly downloading a file from the site, to uploading once a day - when updating data on the site, it happens at the same time.
    This will create a file in the folder and future conversions or searches for new currencies will go through this file.
  This will speed up the speed of the program, because now there are problems with it. Choose the currency to which to transfer.----------
This was fixed.

  Make the variability of the output of the value of the currency not in UAH, but in another currency.
